Notes about screen captures for future referance (photos taken 2021-03-25 7:31pm)

1. EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD looked fine (given large enough screen size

2. CUSTOM option is limited to 50x50 and 1000 mines, but due to my laptop size is wrapped an looked off (but may still be viewable since it auto aligned in a staggared manner... not sure this is fixable, but may remove custom option depending on how the program works out.
